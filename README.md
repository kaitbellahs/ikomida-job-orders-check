## Role

Sweeps orders still `WAITING_PAYMENT` or `OPEN` more than fifteen minutes after creation, joins them against their contract, payment and user records, and resolves them.

This job exists because distributed payment flows genuinely fail halfway: a provider times out, a webhook never arrives, a client closes the app mid-checkout. Something has to notice. Treating that as inevitable — rather than assuming the happy path — is the point.
